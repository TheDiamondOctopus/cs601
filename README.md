This project is a simple pizza ordering web application that allows the user to place an order for a select number of pizzas and pay for them online. The user can choose delivery or carryout, and can enter their credit card information to pay for the pizza.

I have provided the files to run the project locally, but I also hosted the project at the following address using Github Pages:
